# 🇹🇳 Tunisie Hub

**Tunisie Hub** is a digital platform that serves as a cultural and technological space for Tunisians and friends of Tunisia. It is a blog-based website enhanced with a smart **chatbot** that helps users explore Tunisian innovation, artisanship, tech insights, and economic thought — all in one place.

## 🧠 Project Description

Tunisie Hub is more than a blog. It’s a living, growing ecosystem aiming to:
- Promote Tunisian culture, startups, and digital creativity
- Share resources on entrepreneurship, design, technology, and economy
- Provide interactive assistance via a chatbot for user support and content discovery

Built with a clean, modern design and automation-ready backend, this platform can be extended with advanced features like AI recommendations, comment sections, and community integration.
